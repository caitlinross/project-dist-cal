What has been done so far:

The full Wuu and Bernstein algorithm has been implemented, but not fully tested.
Sockets set up and message passing has been tested between 2 computers.
socket connections are using threads, synchronization has just been added, but not tested.
Writing to log has been implemented.
Very simple UI set up for creating appointments


What still needs to be done:
- although W&B implemented, some details relevant specifically to calendar not implemented yet (Erika)
- recovering from crash failure (Caitlin)
    - will need to save calendar info to disk to support this
- appointment conflict resolution
- need to keep track of when processes are up/down
- keep queue of messages that have tried to send when process is down
- add in appointment cancellation (in UI)
- add in view appointments feature to UI
- test on AWS
- write report of design and implementation
