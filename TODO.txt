What has been done so far:

The full Wuu and Bernstein algorithm has been implemented, but not fully tested.
Sockets set up and message passing has been tested between 2 computers.
socket connections are using threads, synchronization has just been added, but not tested.

- add in appointment cancellation (in UI) (Erika)
- add in view appointments feature to UI (Erika)
